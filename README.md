# Pizza-Order-Website

### Description:
I created a simple online pizza ordering website. The application consists of four pages where users can enter their name, select pizza toppings, confirm their order, and receive a thank-you message.

### Tools Used:
For this project, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript for client-side functionality, and PHP for server-side programming. I also utilized AJAX for dynamic updates without page reloads.

### Features:
- Page 1: Users enter their first and last names.
- Page 2: Users are greeted with their first name and can select pizza toppings with dynamic price updates.
- Page 3: Users confirm or cancel their order and view a summary.
- Page 4: Users receive a thank-you message with their full name and choice of confirmation or cancellation.
- Input validation ensures names are alphabetic and not blank.
- Dynamic price calculation for pizza toppings.
- Consistent styling across all pages with a centered heading and background color.
- External CSS stylesheet for easy styling management.

### Install and Run Instructions:
To run the application, you need a web server with PHP support. Simply download or clone the project from GitHub, and place it in your web server directory. Then, navigate to the starting page in your web browser to begin ordering pizzas.

### Interesting Parts during the Build Process:
Implementing dynamic price updates using AJAX was particularly intriguing. It allowed me to create a seamless user experience without page reloads.

### Difficulties we had and how we overcame them:
One challenge was ensuring consistent styling across all pages. I overcame this by carefully planning the CSS structure and using external stylesheets to apply consistent styling.

### Future Updates and Fixes:
In the future, I plan to add more customization options for pizza toppings, such as allowing users to select quantities or choose from additional toppings. I also aim to improve the user interface and add error handling for smoother interactions.
